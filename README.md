bbfy BBCode Processor
=====================

bbfy is a modular, extensible [BBCode] parser and converter for
[node.js]/[io.js] and web browsers.

Installation
------------

For use with node.js or io.js, bbfy can be installed through [npm]:

    npm install bbfy

bbfy can also be run inside web browsers, by using bbfy.browser.js. Since it
supports [UMD], it can be integrated standalone or through an [AMD] loader such
as [RequireJS]. Rename bbfy.browser.js to bbfy.js and copy it to your project.
For standalone use, reference it through a `source` tag:

    <script src="bbfy.js"></script>

AMD loaders can simply list and use `bbfy` as a `require` or `define`
dependency:

```javascript
require(['bbfy'], function (bbfy) {
  ....
}
```

Copying bbfy.browser.js.map is optional and provides debugging capabilities as
bbfy.browser.js is uglified.

Usage
-----

bbfy exposes one function, `converter`, which optionally takes an object of
options. Invoking `converter` returns and anonymous function that converts
BBCode-enriched text based on the provided ruleset.

```javascript
var convert = bbfy.converter();
var bbcode = '[b]Hello World![/b]';
var html = convert(bbcode); // <b>Hello World!</b>
```

The default ruleset converts BBCode to standards-compliant HTML.

All defaults are exposed via `bbfy.options` and pre-defined rulesets as
`bbfy.ruleSets`. The call to `converter` supports overriding the ruleset by
setting the key `rules`. Additionally, the key `unsupported` can be assigned to
a fallback function handling unknown BBCode tags. The default one just strips
off the tags.

The internal API is exposed through `bbfy.api` and should only be used at your
own discretion as there a no guarantees towards stability or consistency
throughout releases.

API
---

<dl>
<dt>bbfy.converter({ rules, unsupported, lineTags } (optional)) => fn (string) => string</dt>
<dd>BBCode to anything converter. `rules` has to be an object mapping tag names
to functions of the form `fn (text, tag, args) => string`. The input string is the text
inside the bbcode tags. `tag` is the name of the tag itself. The format of
`args` depends on the kind of assignment present, if any, and can be a simple
string or an object. The converter may through an error message if there is a
fatal error during parsing th input string, but this is unlikely to ever
happen. `unsupported` get called for properly parsed tags that don't match any
rule in the ruleset and takes the same options as the other rules. `lineTags` is
an array of BBCode tags to be terminated by newlines.</dd>

<dt>bbfy.options</dt>
<dd>Contains the defaults for rulesets, unsupported tags and line tags. Here it
is possible to override them on a global scale.</dd>

<dt>bbfy.ruleSets</dt>
<dd>A mapping of predefined rulesets. By default, only `strip` and
`html`. `strip` removes all BBCode tags, which is useful e.g. for web standard
notifications.</dd>

<dt>bbfy.api</dt>
<dd>Exposes all internal functions, mainly for unit testing purposes. As there
are no guarantees for the API, please see the source code itself if you want to
use it anyway.</dd>
</dl>

Development
-----------

bbfy is written in [ES6] and built using [gulp]. Run `npm install` to fetch all
dependencies needed for building bbfy and `gulp compile` to build the node.js
version in `target/bbfy.js`. `gulp bundle` builds the browser version bundling
all dependencies using browserify. The output file is `target/bbfy.browser.js`.
`gulp test` runs all tests and `gulp watch` watches for source code or test code
changes and re-runs all building and test tasks on demand.

If you don't want to install gulp globally, you can run it off the local node
depedency cache: `node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js`.
